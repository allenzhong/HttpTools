HttpTools
=========

**HttpClient** and **Fetch** are used in my work and some projects are based json or other types of web request and response.


Then I found there is a bug in the version of **Fetch** I have. The **HTTP method POST** is unavailable.

And **HttpClient** cannot encode response html data with any charset. 

So, I try to write a application for myself resolving this problems.

It's not finish yet.
Just fun ~

Some features will be implement later:

1. Custom Raw body
2. Highlight response html or others(Eg. JSON,XML and etc.)
3. Custom Response Text View(Eg. Font,Color,Background and etc.)
4. History of Every Request and Response
5. List XHR information just like Chrome Browser Develop Tool
6. Anything I think must be do.
